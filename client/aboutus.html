        <p>While extensively explored as a solution to poverty at the base of the pyramid, this is the first in-depth examination of entrepreneurship and the poor within advanced economies. Entrepreneurship is presented as a source of empowerment that represents an alternative pathway out of poverty. The book explores the underlying nature of poverty and draws implications for new venture creation.
            <br><br>
            This book fosters a richer dialog among academics, government officials, policy makers, economic development professionals, bankers and the financial community, leaders of non-profit organizations, and others committed to moving beyond status quo solutions - committed to finding ways to help people create their own entrepreneurial pathways out of poverty.</p>
