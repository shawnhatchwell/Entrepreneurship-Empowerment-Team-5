        <h1>S: Supportive Infrastructure</h1>
        <p>The framework begins with development of a 
		<b style="font-size:20px">supportive infrastructure</b>. 
		Low income neighborhoods generally lack an entrepreneurial ecosystem, 
		and the poor struggle to tap into whatever ecosystems exist within the 
		larger community or region. Importantly, the infrastructure must reflect 
		the unique conditions and needs of the poor, as outlined earlier in this
		chapter. Key infrastructure elements include education/training mechanisms,
		availability of finance, incubators/accelerators, a supportive business
		community, vehicles for social networking/connecting, small business support
		organizations, small business service providers, entrepreneurial role models,
		and entrepreneurial mentors, among others. </p>

        <h1>P: Preparation of the Entrepreneur</h1>
        <p>We then focus on the low income individual and their 
		<b style="font-size:20px">preparation</b> for the entrepreneurial journey. 
		Gaps and shortcomings in the individual's background must be addressed as 
		he/she learns to master business and entrepreneurial competencies. Thus, it 
		is critical to prepare individuals in low-income conditions to become entrepreneurs, 
		providing them with the knowledge, tactics and tools to think and act more 
		entrepreneurially. </p>

        <h1>O: Expanded Opportunity Horizon</h1>
        <p>Next, entrepreneurship is opportunity-driven behavior, and our focus becomes the 
		<b style="font-size:20px">opportunity horizon</b> of the entrepreneur.  
		Here the priority is to continually extend this horizon, enabling the low income 
		individual to recognize more attractive and higher potential possibilities both as 
		the basis for launching the venture, but also to enable ongoing growth and expansion 
		of the business. Based on the market opportunity, a business is conceptualized. All 
		too often, the value proposition on which the business is based is not sufficiently 
		unique. When this happens, customers see the business as a commodity.  </p>

        <h1>D: Finding Sources of Differentiation</h1>
        <p>It becomes difficult for the entrepreneur to achieve sustainable 
		<b style="font-size:20px">differentiation</b> from competitors.  
		The key is strategic thinking, as opposed to reactive or tactical management, 
		as sources of differentiation exist for virtually any business. </p>

        <h1>E: Well-Designed Economic Model</h1>
        <p>Then, the business designed by the low-income entrepreneur must be developed 
		around a viable <b style="font-size:20px">economic model</b>. This typically means 
		not trying to compete with high unit costs, relatively small volumes, and low prices 
		and margins. Rather, the entrepreneur must find innovative ways to capture revenue, 
		price on a value basis, achieve cost economies while keeping overhead low, and reach 
		higher potential market segments.  </p>

        <h1>R: Leverageing Community Resources</h1>
        <p>Finally, the low-income entrepreneur must continually acquire 
		<b style="font-size:20px">resources</b>, which includes not only money, but a wide 
		range of other tangible and intangible resources.  However, the key concept here is 
		resource leveraging, which means finding creative ways to borrow, share, rent, 
		outsource, barter, partner and otherwise tap into resources not owned by the 
		entrepreneur, including community resources.  It involves recognizing things as 
		resources that others do not, taking advantage of one's surroundings, and using 
		resources in non-conventional ways. </p>
