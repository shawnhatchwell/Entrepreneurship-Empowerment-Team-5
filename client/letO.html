        <h1>O: Expanded Opportunity Horizon</h1>
		<p>Next, entrepreneurship is opportunity-driven behavior, and our focus becomes the 
		<b style="font-size:20px">opportunity horizon</b> of the entrepreneur.  
		Here the priority is to continually extend this horizon, enabling the low income 
		individual to recognize more attractive and higher potential possibilities both as 
		the basis for launching the venture, but also to enable ongoing growth and expansion 
		of the business. Based on the market opportunity, a business is conceptualized. All 
		too often, the value proposition on which the business is based is not sufficiently 
		unique. When this happens, customers see the business as a commodity.  </p>
