        <h1>E: Well-Designed Economic Model</h1>
		<p>Then, the business designed by the low-income entrepreneur must be developed 
		around a viable <b style="font-size:20px">economic model</b>. This typically means 
		not trying to compete with high unit costs, relatively small volumes, and low prices 
		and margins. Rather, the entrepreneur must find innovative ways to capture revenue, 
		price on a value basis, achieve cost economies while keeping overhead low, and reach 
		higher potential market segments.  </p>
