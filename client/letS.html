        <h1>S: Supportive Infrastructure</h1>
		<p>The framework begins with development of a 
		<b style="font-size:20px">supportive infrastructure</b>. 
		Low income neighborhoods generally lack an entrepreneurial ecosystem, 
		and the poor struggle to tap into whatever ecosystems exist within the 
		larger community or region. Importantly, the infrastructure must reflect 
		the unique conditions and needs of the poor, as outlined earlier in this
		chapter. Key infrastructure elements include education/training mechanisms,
		availability of finance, incubators/accelerators, a supportive business
		community, vehicles for social networking/connecting, small business support
		organizations, small business service providers, entrepreneurial role models,
		and entrepreneurial mentors, among others. </p>
