        <h1>R: Leverageing Community Resources</h1>
		<p>Finally, the low-income entrepreneur must continually acquire 
		<b style="font-size:20px">resources</b>, which includes not only money, but a wide 
		range of other tangible and intangible resources.  However, the key concept here is 
		resource leveraging, which means finding creative ways to borrow, share, rent, 
		outsource, barter, partner and otherwise tap into resources not owned by the 
		entrepreneur, including community resources.  It involves recognizing things as 
		resources that others do not, taking advantage of one's surroundings, and using 
		resources in non-conventional ways. </p>
